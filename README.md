Identified Significant Delays: Uncovered an average delay of 100 minutes per trip compared to estimated times, highlighting the need for improved route optimization.

Distance Discrepancies: Found that estimated distances exceed actual distances by an average of 25 kilometers, indicating a requirement for more accurate route planning.

Recommended Corrective Actions: Proposed conducting a root cause analysis on delayed routes and refining the route optimization algorithm to incorporate real-time traffic data.
